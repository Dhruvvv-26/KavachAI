## 🔧 Pre-Demo Setup (Do This First!)

### Step 1: Find Your LAN IP

Every time you switch networks (WiFi ↔ iPhone Hotspot), your IP changes.

```bash
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
```

Example output: `172.20.10.2` (iPhone hotspot) or `192.168.1.x` (home WiFi)

### Step 2: Update the Worker App `.env`

Open `worker-app/.env` and replace **every** IP with your current one:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_HOST=<YOUR_IP>

EXPO_PUBLIC_WORKER_ID=6fc7ae56-8cc2-4d32-b8cf-c21844a177ce
EXPO_PUBLIC_POLICY_ID=21bc33f9-fa75-4a27-983b-df1a1b1fe4f1

EXPO_PUBLIC_WORKER_SERVICE=http://<YOUR_IP>:8001
EXPO_PUBLIC_POLICY_SERVICE=http://<YOUR_IP>:8002
EXPO_PUBLIC_TRIGGER_SERVICE=http://<YOUR_IP>:8003
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLAIMS_SERVICE=http://<YOUR_IP>:8004
EXPO_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_SERVICE=http://<YOUR_IP>:8005
EXPO_PUBLIC_ML_SERVICE=http://<YOUR_IP>:8006
```

> **CRITICAL**: The Worker ID and Policy ID above **must match** what `god_mode_demo.py` uses. These are already aligned.

### Step 3: Start Docker Services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Verify all 13 containers are healthy:

```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
```

### Step 4: Seed the Demo Database

```bash
python3 scripts/god_mode_demo.py seed
```

This creates:
- **Rider**: Arjun Kumar (Blinkit cyclist, Delhi Rohini zone)
- **Policy**: Standard tier, ₹127/week, active for 7 days
- **Zone**: Delhi Rohini with AQI/Heat/Rain triggers

### Step 5: Verify APIs Are Reachable (from laptop)

```bash
# Should return JSON with policy data (NOT "Not Found")
curl -s http://localhost:8002/api/v1/policies/worker/6fc7ae56-8cc2-4d32-b8cf-c21844a177ce | python3 -m json.tool | head -10

# Should return claims array
curl -s http://localhost:8004/api/v1/claims/worker/6fc7ae56-8cc2-4d32-b8cf-c21844a177ce | python3 -m json.tool | head -5

# Should return trigger status
curl -s http://localhost:8003/api/v1/trigger/status | python3 -m json.tool | head -5
```

### Step 6: Start Expo (with cache clear!)

```bash
cd worker-app
npx expo start -c
```

> **Always use `-c`** to ensure new env vars are picked up. Expo caches aggressively.

### Step 7: Scan QR Code on iPhone

Open the Camera app → scan the QR → it opens in Expo Go.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Network request failed` | Phone can't reach laptop | Check they're on the **same network** and IP in `.env` is correct |
| `HTTP 404` on policy | Worker ID mismatch or no policy seeded | Run `god_mode_demo.py seed` and verify `.env` uses `6fc7ae56...` |
| Coverage shows "Inactive" | Policy API returns null | Verify policy exists: `curl localhost:8002/api/v1/policies/worker/6fc7ae56...` |
| ₹0 everywhere | Claims/Payments empty for this worker | Run `god_mode_demo.py trigger --scenario clean` to generate claims |
| Errors after network switch | IP changed | Run `hostname -I`, update all IPs in `.env`, restart Expo with `-c` |
| `Port 8081 is running...` | Old Expo instance | Kill it: `kill $(lsof -t -i:8081)`, then restart |

## ⏱️ The 60-Second Demo Narration Sequence

### Setup Before Recording
1. **Split Screen**: Terminal on the **Left**, Phone mirror on the **Right**
2. **Clean State**: Run `python3 scripts/god_mode_demo.py seed` before starting
3. **Expo Go**: Open KavachAI app, verify policy shows "ACTIVE" with ₹127/week
4. **Quiet Mode**: Turn off Slack/WhatsApp notifications

### The Script

| Time | Action (Terminal/App) | Narration Script |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **T+00s** | **Terminal:** `python3 scripts/god_mode_demo.py trigger --scenario clean` | *"We're starting with a clean scenario. KavachAI just detected a severe AQI spike in Rohini, Delhi via our CPCB sensors."* |
| **T+02s** | **App:** Show Home Screen | *"On the rider app, our new Phase 3 segmented threshold components display live ML disruption data. The AQI is dangerously high at 450."* |
| **T+10s** | **Phone:** FCM Notification arrives | *"Instantly, Arjun receives an FCM push notification warning him of the disruption."* |
| **T+15s** | **App:** 5-Minute Trigger Modal Opens | *"Tapping the notification opens our Phase 3 SOAR trigger modal with a 5-minute countdown. To claim his payout, Arjun must verify his current state."* |
| **T+20s** | **App:** GPSCamera Capture | *"He uses our newly integrated GPSCamera. The app captures a dual-selfie and bundles it with a 7-layer anti-spoofing payload—including 10Hz accelerometer RMS and heading changes—uploaded securely via multipart FormData."* |
| **T+28s** | **Terminal:** Watch 'Claim Created' logs | *"Back in the logs, you see the claim and GPSCamera payload processed. A low fraud score of 0.06 means zero manual intervention was needed."* |
| **T+32s** | **Terminal:** `python3 scripts/god_mode_demo.py trigger --scenario spoofed` | *"Now, let's try to break it. A bad actor in Mumbai is spoofing their GPS to trick our Delhi sensors."* |
| **T+45s** | **Terminal:** Watch for `BLOCKED` | *"Our updated Worker App sensor pipeline captures the mock location flag. Fraud score: 0.89. Hard-blocked. Zero payout."* |
| **T+50s** | **Terminal:** `curl ... premium/calculate` | *"Pricing is dynamic. This is our live ML engine weighing AQI risk and seasonality to calculate premiums."* |
| **T+58s** | **Terminal:** `curl ... payments/summary` | *"Finally, our actuarial dashboard API tracks real-time loss ratios to ensure solvency."* |
| **T+62s** | **Browser:** Open `http://localhost:3000` (Admin Dashboard) | *"Here is our Admin Dashboard, the command center for Phase 3."* |
| **T+65s** | **Browser:** Fraud Queue tab | *"You can see our blocked claim with the new per-layer scores here: gps_score, sensor_score, network_score."* |
| **T+68s** | **Browser:** SHAP Explainer | *"Switching to the SHAP Explainer, we set Delhi NCR bicycle standard and hit Calculate..."* |
| **T+72s** | **Browser:** SHAP waterfall renders | *"...the waterfall renders a ₹127/week breakdown across 13 feature bars."* |
| **T+76s** | **Browser:** Zone Heatmap | *"On the completely integrated Zone Heatmap, delhi_rohini pulses red signaling an active trigger with ML disruption overlays."* |
| **T+80s** | **Terminal:** `curl -X POST .../clique/run` | *"To defend against organized networks, we trigger our NetworkX Louvain clique detection."* |
| **T+85s** | **Terminal:** Ring alert displays | *"An alert fires immediately: 80 members detected with a CRITICAL risk level in an 86.9s burst window."* |
| **T+90s** | **STOP RECORDING** | *"Full Phase 3 stack: worker sensor pipeline, admin dashboard, ML pricing, and Louvain ring detection all running live. That is KavachAI."* |
